# OneRingAI examples

This directory contains 34 runnable TypeScript programs covering agents, tools,
streaming, media, connectors, OAuth, search, and MCP. The examples import the
repository source directly, so run them from the repository root after installing
dependencies.

Most AI and search examples make real, billable API calls. Review the prompt,
model, and enabled tools before running them with production credentials.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run examples:check
```

Use Node.js 22 or newer. Add only the credentials needed by the program you want
to run, then use its command below. `npm run examples:check` type-checks every
example without making network calls.

## Text, agents, tools, and infrastructure

| Program | What it shows | Requirements and how to run |
|---|---|---|
| [`simple-text.ts`](./simple-text.ts) | Plain text generation, per-call settings, and JSON Schema structured output through the connector-first API. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npx tsx examples/simple-text.ts` |
| [`simple-text-streaming.ts`](./simple-text-streaming.ts) | The same streaming pattern across every configured OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google connector. Missing providers are skipped. | At least one of `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`; `npx tsx examples/simple-text-streaming.ts` |
| [`basic-agent.ts`](./basic-agent.ts) | An agent using custom weather and restricted arithmetic tools, including the agentic tool-call loop. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npm run example:agent` |
| [`multi-turn-conversation.ts`](./multi-turn-conversation.ts) | Explicit conversation history with `runDirect()`, useful when the application—not `AgentContextNextGen`—owns the transcript. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npm run example:conversation` |
| [`interactive-chat.ts`](./interactive-chat.ts) | Interactive multi-provider chat, streaming, vision URLs/files, clipboard images, provider switching, Microsoft Graph access when configured, and approval-gated JavaScript execution. Type `/help` for commands and `/exit` to quit. | At least one supported provider key; `npm run example:chat` |
| [`multi-provider-comparison.ts`](./multi-provider-comparison.ts) | Sends one prompt through every configured OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Together, DeepSeek, and xAI connector using one API shape. | At least one provider key; `npm run example:providers` |
| [`deepseek-agent.ts`](./deepseek-agent.ts) | Current V4 model, dedicated adapter, host preset selection, reasoning, and JSON Schema output. | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; `npx tsx examples/deepseek-agent.ts` |
| [`json-manipulation-tool.ts`](./json-manipulation-tool.ts) | Agent-driven JSON add/replace/delete operations plus deterministic chaining of multiple `json_manipulate` calls. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npm run example:json-tool` |
| [`agent-with-hooks.ts`](./agent-with-hooks.ts) | Execution hooks, simulated approval, tool-result caching, metrics, and pause/resume control. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npm run example:hooks` |
| [`logging-demo.ts`](./logging-demo.ts) | Logger configuration and structured logs emitted by an agent and a custom calculation tool. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npm run example:logging` |
| [`custom-infrastructure.ts`](./custom-infrastructure.ts) | Skeleton implementations of `ITextProvider`, `ITokenStorage`, and `IToolExecutor`, plus injecting a custom provider into an agent. It uses local smoke tests rather than calling the hypothetical service. | No credential required; `npm run example:custom-infrastructure` |
| [`provider-config-generator.ts`](./provider-config-generator.ts) | An interactive AI assistant that asks business-level questions and generates an OAuth connector configuration. Choosing to save writes `oauth-<name>-config.json` in the current directory. | `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; `npm run example:provider-config` |
| [`provider-config-programmatic.ts`](./provider-config-programmatic.ts) | Non-interactive `ProviderConfigAgent` use, including multi-turn generation of GitHub and Microsoft connector configurations. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npx tsx examples/provider-config-programmatic.ts` |

The interactive chat can execute JavaScript and read user-selected local images.
Its tool calls require approval. The focused Google tool tests below deliberately
use `autoApproveAll` to remain non-interactive; keep that setting confined to
trusted demo tools.

## Streaming, vision, audio, and provider checks

| Program | What it shows | Requirements and how to run |
|---|---|---|
| [`vision-image-input.ts`](./vision-image-input.ts) | Single-image analysis, image comparison, explicit multimodal history, and low-detail image input. It uses public Unsplash URLs. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npm run example:vision` |
| [`audio-demo.ts`](./audio-demo.ts) | OpenAI TTS, STT with timestamps, capability inspection, and an STT → agent → TTS voice pipeline. It writes `tts-output.mp3`, `user-input.mp3`, and `agent-response.mp3` in the current directory. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npx tsx examples/audio-demo.ts` |
| [`openai-realtime.ts`](./openai-realtime.ts) | A server-side Realtime WebSocket session, streamed audio/transcript collection, and minting a short-lived browser client secret without printing the secret. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npm run example:realtime` |

| [`oauth-registry-demo.ts`](./oauth-registry-demo.ts) | Registering several OAuth connectors, inspecting the registry, discovering connector-bound tools, and wiring those tools to an agent. It does not complete browser OAuth or call the registered services. | Credentials are optional for the registry demo; `OPENAI_API_KEY` enables agent construction; `npm run example:oauth-registry` |
| [`oauth-static-tokens.ts`](./oauth-static-tokens.ts) | Mixing API-key and OAuth connectors, authenticated fetch, connector tool discovery, and agent wiring.

It does not call GitHub without completed user OAuth. | OAuth client values are optional for this pattern demo; `npm run example:oauth-multi-user-fetch` |

## MCP

The stdio examples launch [`demo-server.ts`](./mcp/demo-server.ts), which exposes
only synthetic in-memory files, a resource, and a prompt. They do not grant a
child process access to the repository filesystem.

| Program | What it shows | Requirements and how to run |
|---|---|---|
| [`mcp/basic-client.ts`](./mcp/basic-client.ts) | Connect to a local stdio MCP server, discover its tools, register them on an agent, and use one in an LLM turn. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npx tsx examples/mcp/basic-client.ts` |
| [`mcp/resources.ts`](./mcp/resources.ts) | List/read MCP resources and list/get prompt templates without an LLM call. | No credential required; `npx tsx examples/mcp/resources.ts` |
| [`mcp/multi-server.ts`](./mcp/multi-server.ts) | Create two namespaced stdio clients from a typed `MCPConfiguration`, connect all, and expose both tool sets to one agent. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `npx tsx examples/mcp/multi-server.ts` |
| [`mcp/http-client.ts`](./mcp/http-client.ts) | Connect to an existing Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint, inspect capabilities, register remote tools, and let an agent use them. It exits cleanly with setup guidance when no URL is configured. | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `MCP_SERVER_URL`, optional `MCP_SERVER_TOKEN`; `npx tsx examples/mcp/http-client.ts` |
| [`mcp/demo-server.ts`](./mcp/demo-server.ts) | The safe local stdio fixture used by the other MCP examples; accepts optional `--label <name>` to distinguish instances. Normally launch it through a client. | No credential required; manual server command: `node --import tsx examples/mcp/demo-server.ts --label demo` |

## Troubleshooting

- A missing variable causes most examples to fail early with the exact variable
  name. Add it to `.env` and rerun.
- A provider can retire a model or reject an expired credential independently of
  the library. The comparison and focused provider checks identify which provider
  failed.
- `oauth-demo.ts` binds an ephemeral loopback port. Run it in an environment that
  permits local listeners.
- `mcp/http-client.ts` needs a separately running Streamable HTTP MCP server; the
  repository only supplies the stdio demo server.
- Delete the three generated MP3 files when you no longer need the audio demo
  output.
