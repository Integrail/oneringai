# Changelog

All notable changes to HOSEA will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Browser-Based EverWorker Login** - One-click authentication replaces manual JWT token entry
  - "Login to EverWorker" button opens a browser window to the EW login page
  - Supports all EW auth methods (password, Microsoft SSO, OIDC, etc.) via generic `returnTo` mechanism
  - Token (30-day, `llm:proxy` scope) is automatically generated and stored in profile after login
  - Token status badges on profile cards: "Token expired" (red) or "Expires in Xd" (yellow)
  - One-click re-authentication button for expired/expiring tokens
  - Displays authenticated user name on profile cards
  - Graceful fallback to manual token entry for older EW instances without browser auth support
  - Version detection: checks `/api/v1/hosea-auth/status` before opening auth window
  - Token expiry checked on app startup with push notification to renderer
  - Expired tokens block sync attempts with clear error message
- **Multi-Profile Everworker Backend** - Support multiple named EW backend profiles with instant switching
  - Add, edit, delete named profiles (e.g., Production, Staging, Dev)
  - Active profile dropdown with live switching — purges old connectors and syncs new ones immediately
  - Per-profile test connection and sync buttons
  - Profile cards showing connector count, last sync time, and status
  - Auto-migration from old single `everworker-backend.json` format to new `everworker-profiles.json`
  - Legacy API wrappers maintained for backward compatibility
- **Live Connector Refresh** - Switching EW profiles now pushes `everworker:connectors-changed` events to the renderer
  - LLM Connectors, Universal Connectors, Tool Connectors, Agent Editor, and Agents pages auto-refresh when connectors change
  - Uses React Context (`ConnectorVersionContext`) for efficient re-rendering
- **Agent Connector Availability** - Agents page now checks if each agent's connector is available
  - Agents with unavailable connectors are grayed out (50% opacity) with a warning icon
  - Chat button is disabled for agents whose connector is missing (e.g., after EW profile switch)
  - Tooltip explains the issue and suggests switching EW profile or editing the agent
  - Edit button remains enabled so users can reassign the agent to a different connector
- **Dynamic Version Display** - About page and Settings modal now show version from `package.json` via `app.getVersion()` IPC
  - Added `window.hosea.app.getVersion()` preload API
  - Replaced hardcoded "Version 0.1.0" in both SettingsPage and SettingsModal
- **Current Context Display in Dynamic UI** - In-context memory entries can now be shown in the sidebar
  - New `showInUI` field on `InContextEntry` — agents set it via `context_set` tool to display entries in the sidebar
  - Tool description references system prompt formatting capabilities (markdown, code blocks, diagrams, charts, etc.)
  - New "Current Context" section in Dynamic UI tab renders entries as cards with full markdown rendering
  - Each card shows key name, priority badge, description, and markdown-rendered value (same `MarkdownRenderer` as chat)
  - User pin/unpin toggle per entry — pinned keys always show regardless of agent's `showInUI` setting
  - Pinned keys persist per-agent to `~/.oneringai/agents/<id>/ui_config.json`
  - Real-time updates via `onEntriesChanged` callback with 100ms debounce
  - New `ui:context_entries` stream chunk type for main→renderer IPC
  - Notification dot on Dynamic UI tab when context entries update while on another tab
  - **Collapsible context cards** — click card header to collapse/expand, showing only the key name when collapsed
  - **Full-view mode** — maximize button on each card fills the entire sidebar with that card's scrollable content; other cards and Dynamic UI are hidden until exiting full view

### Fixed
- **Current Context entries not appearing** - Context entries with `showInUI: true` were not reliably delivered to the renderer due to the 100ms debounce timer firing after the stream ended. Added a final flush of InContextMemory entries at the end of each `streamInstance()` call to guarantee delivery.

### Changed
- **Settings > Everworker Backend** - Complete UI redesign for multi-profile management
  - Replaced single URL/token form with profile-based card layout
  - Added Add/Edit modal, Delete confirmation, and per-profile action buttons (Test, Sync, Activate, Edit, Delete)

### Fixed
- **Version display** - About page now shows actual app version instead of hardcoded "0.1.0"

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Everworker Backend Proxy Integration** - Connect HOSEA to an Everworker backend for centrally managed AI connectors
  - API keys managed on the EW server, not stored on desktops
  - JWT-based authentication with `llm:proxy` scope
  - Transparent HTTP reverse proxy - all vendor SDKs work without changes via `baseURL` override
  - **Mixed mode**: local connectors and EW connectors coexist seamlessly
  - Works for all connector types: LLM text, image, video, TTS, web search, universal APIs
- **Settings > Everworker Backend** - New settings section to configure EW backend connection
  - Backend URL and JWT token configuration
  - Test connection button to verify connectivity
  - Sync connectors button to fetch available connectors from EW
  - Enable/disable toggle for EW integration
- **Connector Source Badges** - LLM Providers page shows "EW" badge for Everworker connectors and "Local" badge for local ones
  - EW connectors show available models
  - EW connectors are marked as "Managed by Everworker" (key management disabled)
- **IPC Bridge** - New `window.hosea.everworker` API for renderer communication
  - `getConfig()`, `setConfig()`, `testConnection()`, `syncConnectors()`
- **Connector Source Tracking** - `StoredConnectorConfig` now includes `source` field (`'local' | 'everworker'`)

### Fixed
- **EW Sync: Non-LLM connectors no longer appear in LLM Providers** - `syncEWConnectors()` now routes connectors by type: LLM vendors (openai, anthropic, etc.) go to the LLM providers store, while non-LLM services (slack, github, zenrows, serper, etc.) go to the Universal Connectors store
- **EW Sync counter** - Sync now reports "X added, Y updated, Z removed" instead of showing "0 added" on re-sync
- **EW Proxy: 0 connectors available** - Proxy discovery endpoint now reads from the oneringai `Connector` registry (populated by V25 startup) instead of a separate empty Map
- **EW discovery endpoint** - Now includes `type` ('llm' | 'universal') and `serviceType` fields for each connector
- **Improved logging** - Added detailed logging for EW connection testing and connector discovery on both Hosea and EW sides

### Changed
- **Universal Connectors page** - Now shows EW/Local source badges, similar to LLM Providers page; EW-managed connectors show "Managed" instead of Edit
- **StoredUniversalConnector** - Added optional `source` field (`'local' | 'everworker'`)

### Removed
- **Legacy API Connectors system** - Removed dead `apiConnectors` Map, `StoredAPIConnectorConfig` interface, `loadAPIConnectors()` method, CRUD methods, IPC handlers (`api-connector:*`), and preload bridge. The migration function (`migrateAPIConnectorsToUniversal`) is preserved for existing users
