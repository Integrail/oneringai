# Browser Automation & Routines

- **Browser Automation** — Agents can now browse the web: navigate, click, type, and read pages using an embedded Chromium browser. Browser view attaches directly to the HOSEA window.
- **Routines** — Create reusable multi-step workflows with the visual Routine Builder. Execute routines on any agent tab with live progress tracking.
- **Dynamic UI** — Agents can render custom UI (forms, tables, charts, progress bars) in a sidebar panel while working.
- **Overlay Detection** — Automatic popup/modal detection during browser automation. Agents can dismiss cookie banners and other overlays.
