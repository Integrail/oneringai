# Local AI & OAuth Improvements

- **Run AI Locally with Ollama** — Install and manage Ollama directly from HOSEA. No API keys needed. Smart model recommendations based on your system RAM.
- **One-Click OAuth** — Authorize vendor connectors (GitHub, QuickBooks, Ramp) with a single click. Tokens persist across restarts with AES-256-GCM encryption.
- **OAuth Scope Selector** — Fine-grained scope control with checkbox-based selector showing human-readable descriptions.
- **Routines** — Create and run multi-step automated workflows. Build routines with the visual Routine Builder, then execute them on any agent tab.
- **Ollama Model Download** — Manage and download Ollama directly from the new Settings > Local AI tab. Auto-start on launch, external installation detection, and per-platform binary support.
- **What's New Popup** — See release highlights after every update, with the ability to browse previous versions.
